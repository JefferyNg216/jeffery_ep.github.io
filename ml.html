						</ul>
						Initially, my typical approach of learning involves previewing the entire module to understand what I need to learn, rather than tackling it section by section. This strategy helps me to effectively summarize the key concepts and better allocate my time to different sections.<br>
						<br>
						During my exploration of the machine learning module, I identified several critical sections that required in-depth understanding to successfully complete my assessments. These sections raised fundamental questions such as:<br>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">How does a Neural Network function?</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">What interactions occur between neurons?</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">What does machine learning look like in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)?</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">How to evaluate the model performance and fine-tune it?</li>
						</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">To clarify these concepts for myself, there are two major ways employed. The activities included in the module is one of the core methods, it serves as fundamental methods for understanding the proceedings. Due to the extensive number of activities involved, I will primarily document the key activities that have helped me grasp the concepts of machine learning and the structure and operation of neural networks.</p>
						In Unit 3, we focused on understanding and applying various statistical techniques and models that measure relationships between variables, including four major activities covered:<br>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						<!-- <li style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="ml_link/Unit03 Ex1 covariance_pearson_correlation.ipynb" target="_blank" style='color:#1155CC'>covariance_pearson_correlation</a></li> -->
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r4pZ35tAK21bfm2sDbvnwYs98f7sNrJs/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style='color:#1155CC'>covariance_pearson_correlation</a></li>

						<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RzTwJ7AMHgOn4sDxj4d8NODWhZoyRJvf/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style='color:#1155CC'>multiple_linear_regression</a></li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KY_JQJlkB1XzrJHqW7UqaodnqJ7FeC_z/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style='color:#1155CC'>Polynomial_regression</a></li>
						(University of Essex, 2024)
						</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Completing the activities provides a clear understanding of how to choose between linear and polynomial regression, which are:-
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Correlation Coefficient:
						<ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-bottom: 0px;">This statistic is key in choosing the regression type. A correlation coefficient near 1 or -1 indicates a strong linear relationship, favoring linear regression. A coefficient near 0 suggests a weak linear relationship, possibly necessitating polynomial regression for curvilinear data patterns.</ul>
						</li>
						<br>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Visual Inspection:
						<ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-bottom: 0px;">Scatter Plots - Plotting data can visually expose the relationship type. A linear trend suggests linear regression, while a curved pattern may better suit polynomial regression to capture relationship nuances.</ul>
						</li>
						</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Therefore, the decision between linear and polynomial regression should be based on statistical correlation measures and visual data analysis. This dual approach ensures a robust model selection process.
						<br><br>
						Then in Unit 7, three detailed activities were undertaken to deepen our understanding of neural network fundamentals, specifically focusing on the workings of perceptrons, including:-
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tXYr29QvBKdM1O10Y3pOuRzA9oz1vzNu/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style='color:#1155CC'>Unit07 Ex1 simple_perceptron.ipynb</a>: It introduces the basic structure and functionality of a simple perceptron. It serves as a foundational activity that demonstrates how input data is processed through weights and biases to produce an output. The key focus is on initializing weights and understanding the perceptron’s decision-making process.</li>
						<br>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aW4xfrRtPhTbJzPNTnf2xlHdfjKLr5Dy/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style='color:#1155CC'>Unit07 Ex2 perceptron_AND_operator.ipynb</a>: Building upon the simple perceptron, this exercise employs the perceptron model to simulate logical AND operations. It illustrates how perceptrons can be used for basic logical processing, emphasizing the tuning of weights and the importance of activation functions in producing correct logical outputs.</li>
						<br>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QZ650R9_DbQp2CVqI107nlnTn2PlYmYZ/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style='color:#1155CC'>Unit07 Ex3 multi-layer Perceptron.ipynb</a>: Advancing to a more complex structure, this activity explores the multi-layer perceptron (MLP). It delves into the architecture involving multiple layers of neurons, showcasing how complex functions can be learned through the introduction of hidden layers. It covers crucial concepts such as backpropagation, weight updates, and the role of various hyperparameters in refining the model’s accuracy and efficiency during training.</li>
						(University of Essex, 2024)
						<br><br>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						These activities collectively cover the key concepts of how weights are initialized and updated in neural networks, and the steps and parameters involved in training these models to accurately process and predict outputs.
						<br><br>
						Finally, in unit 9 & 11, the activity "<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zPpa7Y1aAdaRvpPs3hU-s0S45g2KuasF/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style='color:#1155CC'>Unit09 Ex1 Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - Object Recognition.ipynb</a>” and “<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13Q5Ckm_ZgzjRUdHPs0XzRcApAVpT4m9U/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" style='color:#1155CC'>Unit11_model_Performance_Measurement.ipynb</a>” illustrate key checkpoints in a CNN model's lifecycle. These include using the CIFAR-10 dataset for diverse image input, normalizing these inputs for optimal neural network performance, and encoding labels, often through one-hot encoding. The exercises emphasize separating a validation set to fine-tune the model without overfitting, constructing the CNN architecture with layers suited for image processing, and implementing early stopping based on validation performance to prevent overtraining. Model evaluation is thorough, involving not only testing on unseen data but also generating detailed classification reports and confusion matrices to assess accuracy and identify misclassifications. Lastly, the model's practical application is demonstrated through its ability to predict categories for new images, showcasing its real-world utility.
						(University of Essex, 2024)
						<br><br>
						More than that, I also use UML diagrams to map out the processes involved in machine learning. This visual aid not only makes the information more memorable but also allows me to correct any misunderstandings as I progress in my learning journey.
						<br><br>
						First, I've created the figure below (Figure 1) which illustrates the operation of a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) model to assist me in understanding the Neural Networks, tailored for ensemble level learning using methods such as bagging or boosting. The network's architecture consists of multiple layers:
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Input Layer: This layer accepts the initial data inputs, which in this example could be various features of a dataset or specific questions. Each neuron here symbolizes an individual feature or a unique aspect of the input.</li>
						<br>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Hidden Layers: These layers process the inputs from the previous layer through weighted connections. Each neuron applies a non-linear transformation to its inputs, which are then forwarded to the subsequent layer. The complexity and depth of these layers enhance the model's ability to learn from complex datasets by capturing intricate non-linear relationships.</li>
						<br>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Output Layer: This final layer generates the prediction or classification results based on the processed inputs from the preceding layers. In this scenario, it could represent an answer or decision derived from the processed inputs.</li>

						Figure 1. Neural Network Structure
						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						After having established a basic understanding of neural networks above, Figure 2 delves into the specifics of neuron interactions within a neural network, which include:
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Weight Initialization: Each connection from one neuron to another has a weight that is initially set.</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Activation Function: This function transforms the weighted input from the neuron into an output that is sent to the next layer.</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Forward Pass: The output is passed forward through the network to the output layer.</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Loss Calculation: At the output layer, the network calculates the error (loss) between the predicted output and the actual output.</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Backpropagation: If the output isn’t accurate, the error is sent back through the network. This backpass adjusts the weights using a method called gradient descent to minimize the error.</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Weight Update: Based on the error, the weights are updated to produce a more accurate output in the next forward pass.</li>
						(Geeksforgeeks, 2024)
						<br><br>
						The process iterates, continually adjusting weights to increase accuracy, and then moves to the next neuron, improving the network's overall performance.

						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						Finally, figure 3 outlines the training process for a machine learning model, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The summary of the steps involved:
						<br>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Start Training: The process begins by dividing the data into a training set and a validation set. The training set is used to train the model, while the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance to ensure it generalizes well to new data.</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Validation: After training on the training set, the model makes predictions which are then validated against the validation set. This step checks how well the model's predictions match the actual data.</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Early Stopping: This mechanism is used to prevent the model from overfitting. The process involves several checks:<ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-bottom: 0px;">
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Calculate Validation Loss: The loss (error) on the validation set is calculated to gauge the accuracy of the model.</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Check for Maximum Epochs: The model checks if the maximum number of training cycles (epochs) has been reached. If not, it assesses whether there is still room for improvement in reducing validation loss.</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Room to Improve: If the model can still improve (validation loss can decrease), training continues. Otherwise, the model checks if it has reached the patience limit, which is the number of epochs to wait before stopping when no improvement is seen.</li></ul></li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Model Evaluation: Once the training stops—either from reaching the maximum epochs or if there is no improvement even after additional epochs—the model is finally evaluated to see how well it performs overall.</li>

						<br><br>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">In conclusion, the machine learning module provides a detailed exploration of various aspects of machine learning, from basic concepts and data handling to complex model architectures like neural networks. It thoroughly covers the types of machine learning—unsupervised, supervised, and reinforced—and delves into specific methods such as clustering and regression analysis. The module also addresses statistical techniques for understanding data relationships and evaluates model performance through practical activities and visual tools. By implementing both statistical analysis and experiential learning through activities, the module ensures a robust understanding of both theoretical and practical aspects of machine learning. This comprehensive approach prepares me to effectively apply machine learning techniques in real-world scenarios, enhancing both their learning experience and practical skills.</p>

						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						<u>Introduction</u><br>
						At the conclusion of this module, I find the journey through the machine learning content to be quite exhilarating. While certain segments presented challenges, overall, I have enjoyed the progress and am satisfied with the learning outcomes. In this final reflection section, I will utilize the six stages of Gibbs' Reflective Cycle (Main P., 2023) to provide a structured summary of my study experience.
						<br><br>
						<u>Description and Analysis</u><br>
						In the learning summary outlined above, the necessary techniques and best practices for the machine learning model are detailed for our professional development. Nevertheless, several challenges and considerations were identified during the assessment implementation.

						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Applicability and Challenges of data
						<ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-bottom: 0px;">The implementation of the Unit 6 assessment, which involved conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to address specific business inquiries, highlighted the importance of selecting the appropriate data. Decisions about which data to utilize should be primarily driven by the business objectives. Additionally, it is crucial to consider whether the goals are extensive and if the dataset contains enough information to identify relevant issues (Thilakarathne H., 2022). Effective communication with stakeholders and possessing relevant domain knowledge are essential requirements for this process.</ul></li>
						<br>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Furthermore, several additional challenges were identified, such as:<ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-bottom: 0px;">
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Data Lack: During the analysis stage, a deficiency in data can occur due to inadequate consideration in the initial stages.</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Dark Data: While storing as much data as possible might seem like a solution to the data lack issue, it can lead to problems with dark data, which may significantly increase computational and maintenance resources (IBM, N.D).</li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">High Dimensionality: Datasets with an excessively high number of features can complicate model training, a phenomenon known as the "curse of dimensionality" (Karanam S., 2021).</li></ul></li>
						<ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 40px;">Besides these specific issues, there are other common data-related challenges in machine learning, including data quality, insufficient training data, and problems related to overfitting or underfitting (Saxena A., 2024).</ul>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Real-World Challenges of Machine Learning</li>
						<ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 40px;">From the implementation of the Unit 11 assessment, which involved using CNN models for image identification, it's clear that this practice has become popular and can be applied to various business areas. These include image classification and face recognition for social media and citizen identification, Optical Character Recognition for document digitization, and image computing and predictive analytics in healthcare data science for risk assessment (Bilyk V., 2020).</ul>

						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						However, this also brings with it a number of debates concerning machine learning, with major focus areas including:

						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Legal and Privacy<br>
						<ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 0px;">While machine learning seamlessly integrates into our social networks, it frequently employs algorithms tailored to predict user preferences in areas such as shopping, music, and leisure activities. Although these predictive capabilities enhance user experience by personalizing content, they also bring with them substantial privacy concerns. The collection and analysis of personal data to feed these algorithms can lead to potential breaches of user confidentiality and raise ethical and legal questions about data use and consent.</ul></li>
						<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Social and Ethical<br>
						<ul style="list-style-type: circle;margin-left: 0px;">As AI becomes increasingly integrated into job roles and tasks, such as process automation and chatbots, human interaction decreases. ChatGPT is a prime example of this trend. Consider a situation where you encounter a problem while studying; who is your first point of contact? Personally, I often turn to ChatGPT and frequently search Google for answers, instead of colleagues and tutor. Currently, social interaction is already on the decline due to the pervasive use of mobile devices and the internet. With the rapid advancement of machine learning technology, a further decrease in face-to-face interactions is anticipated.
						(Whyte T. J., 2019)</ul></li>
						Although machine learning presents certain challenges as it evolves, in a rapidly changing world it represents a necessary advancement. People must adapt to and regulate this technology to harness its full potential while mitigating its risks.
						</p>
						<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">
						<u>Feelings and Evaluation</u>
						<br>
						The first assessment in Unit 6 began with a team project, marking my second group project participation during my Master of Data Science. Honestly, given the choice, I would prefer to undertake individual projects as I find them more efficient to manage on my own. This preference isn’t a reflection on my team members, but rather on my own working style. However, I recognize the value of team projects, which are crucial for mimicking professional work environments and everyday life where teamwork is often essential. This experience has taught me how to manage time effectively and adapt to unexpected results.
						<br><br>
						In addition, after gaining a detailed understanding of machine learning from the module, I must say that it is both a fascinating and challenging subject. I have particularly enjoyed learning about how it works, especially my initial exposure to understanding the operations of Artificial / Convolutional Neural Networks (ANN / CNN). Approximately 50% to 60% of my study time was devoted to dissecting the details of these networks. Despite having completed the Unit 11 assessment, I feel like I have only touched on the basics and there are still several experiments I would like to try. These include using the best epoch and random sampling, improvements that were mentioned at the end of the Unit 11 assessment.
						<br><br>
						Meanwhile, testing the effects of adjusting various parameters of the CNN to observe changes in prediction results (e.g. classification report & Confusion Matrix) and verifying whether it correctly identifies images has also been quite intriguing.
						<br><br>
						<u>Conclusion and Action Plan</u>
						<br>
						As the module draws to a close, although we've covered detailed methodologies in machine learning, there are still numerous avenues to explore and delve deeper into. This continued investigation is vital for expanding the knowledge we have gained.
						<br><br>
						Meanwhile, integrating the knowledge gained from this module into my professional development is another crucial aspect. As a Data Analyst currently engaged in EDA and ETL development, my role primarily involves scrutinizing source data. A persistent challenge is that the data layout often arrives in PDF format, requiring manual inspection. This experience has led me to consider whether the CNN technology we learned could be applied in areas such as OCR to streamline this process. Additionally, I have a few side projects involving data scraping with Python and uploading to my AWS/Azure databases for analysis. I am eager to see if machine learning techniques for predicting continuous values could be beneficial to these projects as well.
